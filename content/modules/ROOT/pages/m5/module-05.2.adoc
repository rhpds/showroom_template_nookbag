== Explore updates to Production Argo CD Manifests

* In the previous section, we noted that a Merge Request has been raised on the Prod Argo CD manifest to update the prod image.
* On {product_name_rhdh}, in the `parasol-store` component's https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store/pr[Pull/Merge Requests page, window="rhdh"], you can view the a list of Gitlab Merge Request Statuses.

== Conclusion

A developer can effortlessly set up an ephemeral development environment, build and test their code, and seamlessly advance it to production with the necessary guardrails in place.

All of this is accessible through a single-pane-of-glass experience on {product_name_rhdh}, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools and platforms to track both inner-loop and outer-loop progress and statuses. 

The dynamic plugins that you enabled in previous modules provide incredible value to this experience by integrating real-time insights and providing contextual visibility, ensuring a smooth and efficient development lifecycle, there by reducing developer cognitive overload and streamlining the development lifecycle.
