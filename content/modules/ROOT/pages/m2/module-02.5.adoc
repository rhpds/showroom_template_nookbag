== Activity: Configure OpenID Connect Authentication

include::../style.adoc[]

{product_name_rhdh} supports four authentication providers:

* Guest (suitable for experimentation and demos only)
* OpenID Connect
* GitHub
* Microsoft Azure

In this activity you'll configure an OpenID Connect authentication provider - this will enable developers within your organization to login using their single sign-on (SSO) credentials.

=== High-Level Workflow

A complete set of documentation for configuring OpenID Connect authentication using https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[Red Hat Single Sign-On^, window="content"] is available in the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.5/html/authentication_in_red_hat_developer_hub/assembly-authenticating-with-rhbk[{product_name_rhdh} documentation^, window="content"].

NOTE: Don't worry if some of the following bullet points are hard to understand upon first reading them. You'll be guided through each piece step-by-step.

The high-level steps involve:

. Creating a Realm and Client in Red Hat Single Sign-On. These have been pre-configured for you. View the `backstage` Realm using the following URL and credentials:
    * *URL*: {sso-link}[Backstage Realm on Red Hat Single Sign-On^, window=sso]
    * *Credentials*: https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/k8s/ns/keycloak/secrets/keycloak-initial-admin[View on OpenShift, window="content"]. (If needed, login to OpenShift as `admin`/`{common_password}`)
. Configuring the {product_name_rhdh} Keycloak plugin to synchronize users from Red Hat Single Sign-On to {product_name_rhdh}.
. Configuring the `oidc` {product_name_rhdh} authentication provider with the Realm details.
. Setting `oidc` as `signInPage` page type for {product_name_rhdh}.
. Enabling session support in {product_name_rhdh}.

=== Configure the OpenID Connect Authentication Provider

. Visit your https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/developer-hub-config/[rhdh/developer-hub-config repository on GitLab, window="gitlab"].
. Open the *values.yaml* file, then select *Edit > Edit single file*.
. Locate the `appConfig.auth` object in the YAML. You can search for `--- AUTHENTICATION ---` in this file to locate this section.
. Delete the existing `auth` configuration that contains the `guest` provider.
. Uncomment the entire `auth` configuration containing the `oidc` provider, and the `signInPage` setting below it.

. The end result will look similar to:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
auth:
  session:
    secret: ${BACKEND_SECRET}
  environment: production
    providers:
      oidc:
        production:
          prompt: auto
          metadataUrl: https://sso.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/realms/backstage/.well-known/openid-configuration
          clientId: ${OAUTH_CLIENT_ID}
          clientSecret: ${OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET}
          signIn:
            resolvers:
              - resolver: preferredUsernameMatchingUserEntityName
signInPage: oidc
----

. This is an example standard Backstage `auth` configuration. Below is a summary of what this configuration specifies:
* Enable sessions, and use the `BACKEND_SECRET` environment variable to sign sessions.
* Set the authentication `environment` to `production`. Environments can have any arbitrary name.
* Enable the OpenID Connect provider (`providers.oidc`) with the following configuration:
** Provide a `production` configuration (corresponding to the `environment` defined previously).
** Use the `backstage` Realm (`metadataUrl`).
** Load the `clientId` and `clientSecret` from environment variables (loaded from the precreated https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/k8s/ns/backstage/secrets/oauth-client[*oauth-client*] Secret, specified in `extraEnvVarsSecrets` in the _values.yaml_)
** Map any signing in user identity to a User Entity in {product_name_rhdh} using the specified https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver/[resolver^, window="console"]. These Users and Groups have already been synchronised to the catalog due to your work in the prior module.
* The `signInPage` property is specific to {product_name_rhdh}. It ensures the correct sign-in UI is rendered. In upstream Backstage this requires React code changes.

. Commit the changes with a message similar to `feat: enable openid connect`
. Click Refresh on the https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications[`backstage` Application in OpenShift GitOps^, window="argo"]. If prompted, login as `admin/{openshift_gitops_password}`.
. Wait until the Application reports being in a *Healthy* state.

=== Login using OpenID Connect Authentication

. Once the latest version of your `appConfig` has been synchronized and rolled out, visit your https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[{product_name_rhdh} instance^, window="rhdh"]. You will be prompted to sign-in using OpenID Connect.

. Login using the username `pe1` and password `{common_password}` in the popup that appears. After logging in, visit the *Settings* page in {product_name_rhdh} to confirm you're logged in as the `pe1` user.
