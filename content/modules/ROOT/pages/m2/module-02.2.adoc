WARNING: The Guest sign-in option is currently enabled, but you'll configure a production-ready sign-in option based on OpenID Connect shortly. The Guest sign-in option is only meant for development and testing purposes.

Visit the *Catalog* using the link in the menu on the left-hand side of the {product_name_rhdh} UI. You'll find that the *Kind* dropdown provides only **Plugin** and **Package** options. These represent plugins that can be installed in {product_name_rhdh}, but these don't represent any of the software components deployed by Parasol. An empty catalog is no good to your developers - you'll address that soon!
