This page walks you through the fastest path to a working Showroom lab on the Red Hat Demo Platform.
Pick the track that matches your environment type.

== Before You Begin

You will need:

* A content repository with your Antora lab instructions (or a fork of the https://github.com/rhpds/showroom_template_nookbag[template]).
See xref:content-repo.adoc[] if you have not created one yet.
* Access to the https://github.com/rhpds/agnosticv[agnosticv] repository to create or edit a catalog item.
* Familiarity with YAML and basic Ansible concepts.

== Path A -- OpenShift 4 Workload

Use this path when your lab provisions an OpenShift cluster and Showroom runs as a pod on that cluster.

=== 1. Add the collection to your catalog item

In your catalog item's `common.yaml`, declare the Showroom collection as a dependency:

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
requirements_content:
  collections:
    - name: https://github.com/agnosticd/showroom.git
      type: git
      version: {showroom-collection-version}
----

=== 2. List the workloads

Add the Showroom workload to your workloads list.
Showroom should come **last** so that all infrastructure and credentials are available:

[source,yaml]
----
workloads:
  - ocp4_workload_my_operators        # your infra workloads first
  - agnosticd.showroom.ocp4_workload_showroom
----

If you want the OpenShift web console embedded as an iframe tab, add `ocp4_workload_ocp_console_embed` or `ocp4_workload_showroom_ocp_integration` before the main Showroom workload.
See xref:ocp-integration.adoc[].

=== 3. Point to your content repo

[source,yaml]
----
ocp4_workload_showroom_content_git_repo: https://github.com/yourorg/your-lab-content.git
ocp4_workload_showroom_content_git_repo_ref: main
----

=== 4. Pin the version for production

In `prod.yaml`, always pin the content branch to a tag or a known-good commit -- never ship `main` to production:

[source,yaml]
----
ocp4_workload_showroom_content_git_repo_ref: v1.0.0
----

=== 5. Order from the catalog

Once your catalog item is merged and synced, order it from https://demo.redhat.com[demo.redhat.com].
The provisioned environment will include a Showroom URL in the access information.

=== Working example

The https://github.com/rhpds/agnosticv/tree/main/tests/showroom-ocp4[tests/showroom-ocp4] catalog item is a complete, minimal example of this path.
It deploys Showroom with the `ocp-example` branch of the template, a Wetty terminal with auto-SSH to the bastion, and the OCP console embed workload.

---

== Path B -- VM Workload

Use this path when your lab provisions VMs (typically on OpenShift CNV) and Showroom runs on the bastion host via Podman.

=== 1. Add the collection to your catalog item

[source,yaml,subs="+attributes"]
----
requirements_content:
  collections:
    - name: https://github.com/agnosticd/showroom.git
      type: git
      version: {showroom-collection-version}
----

=== 2. Include the role in post-software workloads

The VM role runs on the bastion host after all other provisioning is complete:

[source,yaml]
----
post_software_final_workloads:
  bastions:
    - agnosticd.showroom.vm_workload_showroom
----

=== 3. Point to your content repo

[source,yaml]
----
showroom_git_repo: https://github.com/yourorg/your-lab-content.git
showroom_git_ref: main
----

=== 4. Configure terminals

Enable one or more tab services:

[source,yaml]
----
showroom_tab_services:
  - single_terminal

showroom_ssh_method: password
showroom_ssh_host: host.containers.internal
showroom_ssh_username: lab-user
showroom_ssh_password: "{{ common_password }}"
----

=== 5. Set the hostname and TLS

[source,yaml]
----
showroom_host: "{{ bastion_public_hostname }}"
showroom_tls_provider: zerossl           # or 'letsencrypt' or 'none'
----

=== 6. Pin the version for production

In `prod.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
showroom_git_ref: v1.0.0
----

=== Working example

The https://github.com/rhpds/agnosticv/tree/main/tests/showroom-vm[tests/showroom-vm] catalog item is a complete, minimal example.
It deploys Showroom on a bastion VM with two terminals and the `vm-example` branch of the template.
