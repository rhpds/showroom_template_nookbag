= Platform Engineering Workshop

include::style.adoc[]

== Introduction
Many organizations today are grappling with serious challenges that hinder their development teams’ productivity. High cognitive load, lack of standardization, and fragmented domain knowledge are common issues that lead to inefficiencies, increased maintenance costs, and even security vulnerabilities.

Red Hat provides the tools and know-how to help "The Providers" (Platform Engineers) to create "The Product" (their internal developer portal) based on the needs of "The Customers" (all Development Teams within the organization).

== Primary Audience

This workshop is designed for Platform Engineers who are in charge of:

* Creating standards for technologies that are used across environments (Development, Testing, Production)
* Defining processes that maximize Development Teams' efficiency, by unburdening them from platform details.

This workshop is built in a learn-by-example style, where we show you how to create, set up, and manage an IDP using Red Hat Developer Hub. The workshop is opinionated and should be viewed as an example of how to approach things. As always, make sure you, as a Platform Engineer, build what your customers (Development Teams) need by soliciting early feedback to ensure you're on the right track.

== Secondary Audience

This workshop can also help Development Teams who are in charge of creating a software solution, and empower (traditionally speaking) in picking their own tools for coding, building, deploying, running, monitoring and documentation.


== Key Takeways

After completing this workshop you'll:

* Understand the need to implement Platform Engineering disciplines within your organization.
* See clear benefits from improving Developer Productivity.
* Be ready to deploy a Thinnest Viable Platform (TVP) based on the needs of the development teams in your organization, and focus on increasing their productivity.
* Assess the investments into your own IDP and understand how it can be enhanced, and convince development teams to start adopting it.
* View Red Hat as a partner in your Platform Engineering journey.
