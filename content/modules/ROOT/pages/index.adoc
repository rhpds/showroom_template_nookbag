:navtitle: What is Showroom?

Showroom is a web-based lab instruction platform for the https://demo.redhat.com[Red Hat Demo Platform].
It combines rendered AsciiDoc content with embedded terminals, consoles, and interactive tools -- giving workshop and demo participants everything they need in a single browser tab.

== What Users See

When a participant opens their Showroom URL they get a split-pane interface:

* **Left pane** -- step-by-step lab instructions rendered from an https://antora.org[Antora] site you author in AsciiDoc.
* **Right pane** -- one or more tabs such as:
** A web terminal (SSH to a bastion, containerised CLI tools, or both).
** The OpenShift web console embedded in an iframe.
** A VS Code editor (Code Server).
** A VNC desktop (noVNC).
** Any external URL you choose.

The UI layout, tab names, and tab URLs are all controlled by a simple `ui-config.yml` file that lives in your content repository.

== How It Gets Deployed

This Ansible collection -- `agnosticd.showroom` -- is the primary way Showroom instances are deployed on the Red Hat Demo Platform.
Depending on the environment type, you use one of two roles:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Role |Use when...

|`ocp4_workload_showroom`
|Your lab runs on an OpenShift 4 cluster.
The role deploys Showroom as a pod using a Helm chart, complete with content rendering, terminals, and an OpenShift `Route`.

|`vm_workload_showroom`
|Your lab runs on a VM (RHEL, Fedora, etc.).
The role deploys Showroom with rootless Podman, Traefik for TLS, and systemd for lifecycle management.
|===

Both roles follow the same basic flow:

. Clone your Antora content repository.
. Inject runtime variables (credentials, hostnames, GUIDs) as AsciiDoc attributes.
. Render the content to HTML.
. Serve the content alongside the terminal and tab services you configured.
. Publish the final URL back to the user.

== Key Concepts

Content repository::
A Git repo containing your AsciiDoc lab instructions, structured as an Antora component.
You typically fork https://github.com/rhpds/showroom_template_nookbag[showroom_template_nookbag] and add your own pages.
See xref:content-repo.adoc[].

AgnosticV catalog item::
The YAML configuration in the https://github.com/rhpds/agnosticv[agnosticv] repository that ties your content repo to an environment on the Red Hat Demo Platform.
See xref:agnosticv-config.adoc[].

User data::
A set of key-value pairs (hostnames, passwords, URLs) written by infrastructure roles during provisioning and automatically injected into your content as Antora attributes.
See xref:user-data.adoc[].

UI configuration::
A `ui-config.yml` file in your content repo that defines the tabs, layout width, and dynamic URLs shown alongside your lab instructions.
See xref:ui-config.adoc[].
