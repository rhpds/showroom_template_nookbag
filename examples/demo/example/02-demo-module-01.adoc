= Demo Module 1: Your First Pipeline
:source-highlighter: rouge
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 1

In this module you will show how a Tekton pipeline automates the full build-test-deploy
cycle for ACME Corp's application.

== Part 1: Creating the Pipeline

=== Know

ACME currently deploys manually — a developer packages the application, uploads to a server,
and another team member runs deployment scripts. This takes 3-5 days and fails 20% of the time.

*What you will show*: A pipeline that does in 5 minutes what takes ACME 3 days manually.

*Business value*: 60x faster deployments, zero manual steps, consistent every time.

=== Show

. Navigate to *Pipelines* in the OpenShift Developer Console
. Click *Create Pipeline*
. Name the pipeline: `acme-build-deploy`
. Add tasks:
  * `git-clone` → clones the source repository
  * `buildah` → builds the container image
  * `deploy` → rolls out to production
. Click *Create*

Expected result: Pipeline appears in the list with status "Not started".

== Part 2: Running the Pipeline

=== Know

The pipeline connects to ACME's Git repository and automatically builds on every commit.
This replaces 3-5 days of manual work.

=== Show

. Click *Start* on the `acme-build-deploy` pipeline
. Watch the tasks complete in sequence (approximately 3 minutes)
. Click on each task to show real-time logs
. When complete, navigate to *Topology* to see the updated deployment

Expected result: Application updated, pipeline shows "Succeeded" in green.
