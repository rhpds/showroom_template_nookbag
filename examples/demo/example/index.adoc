This guide helps sales engineers and technical presenters deliver an effective demonstration to customers.

Every demo is different — adapt this guide to your specific audience and time constraints.

== Demo Overview
Read this section first. It provides the background, use case, and benefits to present to the customer.

These demos focus on business value rather than technical details. Dive into technical depth only when the customer asks.

== Demo Modules
Each module uses a *Know* and *Show* structure.

=== Know
Background and insights for you and the customer. Describes what you will show and why it matters.

=== Show
Step-by-step guide to follow during the live demonstration.

== Next Steps
Start with the *Demo Overview* section!
