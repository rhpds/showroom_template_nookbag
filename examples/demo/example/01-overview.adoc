OpenShift Pipelines automates CI/CD workflows natively on OpenShift using Tekton.

== Background

ACME Corp releases software every 6-8 weeks. Manual deployments take 3-5 business days,
introduce errors, and block the team from delivering faster.

== Problem

* *Long cycle times*: 6-8 week release cycles → missed market opportunities
* *Manual steps*: Deployment requires 3-5 days of manual work → human error risk
* *Inconsistency*: Each environment configured differently → "works on my machine" issues

Benefits to the customer:

* Reduce deployment time from days to minutes
* Eliminate manual deployment errors
* Consistent builds across dev, staging, and production

== Common Customer Questions

*"How does this integrate with our existing Git workflows?"*
→ Show Module 2 — pipelines trigger automatically on git push

*"What about security and compliance scanning?"*
→ Module 3 demonstrates automated security scanning built into the pipeline

*"How long does it take to set up?"*
→ Module 1 shows a working pipeline running within 10 minutes
