## What to Expect

### Example Workflow

```
You: create lab

Claude: Are you creating a new lab or adding to an existing lab?

Options:
1. Creating a NEW lab (I'll generate: index.adoc → 01-overview → 02-details → 03-module-01)
2. Adding to an EXISTING lab (I'll detect next number and generate: 0X-module-YY only)
3. Something else (please describe)

Your choice? [1/2/3]

You: 1

Claude: Great! Let me gather the overall story first.

What's the overall goal of this lab?

You: Teach developers how to build AI applications on OpenShift AI

Claude: Perfect! Who is this lab for?

[... continues asking questions one at a time ...]

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need API keys?

**A**: No! If you have Cursor, you already have access to Claude. The skills work with Cursor's built-in Claude model.

### Q: Do I need to install anything?

**A**: No! Just clone the repo and open in Cursor. The `.cursorrules` file is already configured.

### Q: Can I use this with Cursor Pro or Cursor Free?

**A**: Works with any Cursor plan that includes Claude access (Pro plan recommended for best experience).

### Q: What if the skill doesn't trigger?

**A**: Be explicit in Cursor chat:
```
Read .claude/skills/create-lab/SKILL.md and follow all instructions
to create a workshop module. Ask questions one at a time.
```

### Q: Where are the files created?

**A**: In `content/modules/ROOT/pages/` directory. You can open them in Cursor to review/edit.

## Tips for Best Experience

### 1. Answer Questions One at a Time

Claude will ask questions sequentially. Answer each one before it asks the next.

### 2. Files Written Automatically

You won't see the full file content in chat. Claude writes files and shows brief summaries. Review files in your editor.

### 3. Use Explicit Commands

If auto-detection doesn't work, be explicit:
- "create lab" (clear)
- "make a module" (might not trigger)

### 4. Have Reference Materials Ready

Skills work better with references:
- URLs to Red Hat documentation
- Local files (Markdown, AsciiDoc, PDFs)
- Existing examples
