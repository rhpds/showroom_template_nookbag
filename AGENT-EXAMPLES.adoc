== Best Practices

=== Agent Workflow Best Practices

1. **Start with migration planning** for large conversions:
   - Use migration-assistant to understand scope
   - Review file mapping before converting

2. **Convert in phases**:
   - Phase 1: Create foundation (nav, index, overview)
   - Phase 2: Convert content modules
   - Phase 3: Apply style and validate quality

3. **Use multiple agents sequentially**:
   - content-converter → style-enforcer → workshop-reviewer → technical-editor

4. **Always validate**:
   - Check Red Hat style with style-enforcer
   - Validate learning objectives with workshop-reviewer
   - Verify accessibility with accessibility-checker

=== Content Quality Checklist

After using agents, verify:

- [ ] nav.adoc created and navigation structure is correct
- [ ] index.adoc created for main landing page
- [ ] 00-index.adoc has facilitator guide information
- [ ] 01-overview.adoc includes customer pain points and business value
- [ ] 02-details.adoc lists prerequisites and environment details
- [ ] Module files (03-*, 04-*, etc.) have learning objectives
- [ ] Exercises include validation steps
- [ ] Headlines use sentence case
- [ ] Product names follow Red Hat standards
- [ ] Inclusive language is used throughout
- [ ] All images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Code blocks specify language for syntax highlighting
- [ ] Showroom variables are used for dynamic content

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

**Agent doesn't follow templates:**

All agents read local examples in `content/modules/ROOT/pages/workshop/`. Verify these directories exist:
- `workshop/example/`
- `workshop/templates/`
- `demo/`

**Style not being applied:**

Agents read `.claude/prompts/redhat_style_guide_validation.txt`. Verify this file exists and is readable.

**Conversion order is wrong:**

The content-converter agent creates files in this order:
1. nav.adoc (navigation)
2. index.adoc (landing page)
3. 00-index.adoc (facilitator guide)
4. 01-overview.adoc (business context)
5. 02-details.adoc (prerequisites)
6. Module files (03-*, 04-*, etc.)

**Missing business context:**

Use this prompt specifically:
----
Use the content-converter agent to add customer pain points and business value to workshop/converted/01-overview.adoc following the pattern in workshop/example/01-overview.adoc
----
