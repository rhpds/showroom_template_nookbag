= Using Showroom Skills in Cursor

This directory contains setup and documentation for using the Showroom content generation skills in Cursor IDE with Claude.

== Quick Start

=== 1. Cursor Already Configured! ✅

The `.cursor/rules/` directory is automatically loaded by Cursor. You don't need to do anything special - just open this repository in Cursor and start using the skills.

=== 2. Simple Commands

In Cursor chat (Cmd+L or Ctrl+L), just say:

*Create a workshop module:*
[source,text]
----
create lab
----

*Create a demo module:*
[source,text]
----
create demo
----

*Verify content quality:*
[source,text]
----
verify content
----

That's it! Claude will read the skill files and guide you through the workflow.

== Available Skills

=== Lab Module Generation

*What it does*: Creates Red Hat Showroom workshop modules with hands-on exercises, step-by-step instructions, and proper AsciiDoc formatting.

*When to use*:

* Creating a new workshop from scratch
* Adding a module to an existing workshop
* Converting documentation into hands-on lab format

*Commands to trigger*:

* "create lab"
* "create-lab"
* "generate workshop module"
* "create workshop"
* "new lab"

*What you'll get*:

* For NEW lab: `index.adoc` + `01-overview.adoc` + `02-details.adoc` + `03-module-01-*.adoc`
* For EXISTING lab: `0X-module-YY-*.adoc` (next module only)

---

=== Demo Module Generation

*What it does*: Creates presenter-led demo content using Know/Show structure for sales engineers and technical demonstrations.

*When to use*:

* Creating business-focused demos for executives
* Sales engineering demonstrations
* Presenter-led technical showcases

*Commands to trigger*:

* "create demo"
* "create-demo"
* "generate demo"
* "create demo"
* "presenter-led demo"

*What you'll get*:

* Know sections (business context, value propositions)
* Show sections (presenter instructions, what to demonstrate)

---

=== Content Verification

*What it does*: Verifies workshop/demo content quality against Red Hat standards.

*When to use*:

* After creating new content
* Before submitting for review
* Quality checking existing modules

*Commands to trigger*:

* "verify content"
* "check quality"
* "review module"

== How It Works

=== Behind the Scenes

. *.cursor/rules/* (Project Rules directory)
+
* Automatically loaded by Cursor when you open this repo
* Contains skill invocation rules and critical guidelines
* Structured format with metadata for each skill
* Tells Claude which skill to use based on your command

. *Skill files* (in `.claude/skills/`)
+
* `create-lab/SKILL.md` - Workshop module generator workflow
* `create-demo/SKILL.md` - Demo content generator workflow
* `verify-content/SKILL.md` - Content verification workflow

. *Shared rules* (in `.claude/docs/`)
+
* `SKILL-COMMON-RULES.md` - Common contracts all skills follow

. *Verification prompts* (in `.claude/prompts/`)
+
* Quality standards, style guides, accessibility requirements

=== What Happens When You Use a Skill

[source,text]
----
You: "create lab"
    ↓
Cursor reads .cursor/rules/create-lab/RULE.md
    ↓
Claude loads .claude/skills/create-lab/SKILL.md
    ↓
Claude asks questions ONE AT A TIME
    ↓
You answer each question
    ↓
Claude generates files using Write tool
    ↓
Shows brief summary (NOT full content)
    ↓
You review files in your editor
----

---

== Important Rules (Automatic in Cursor)

These are enforced automatically by `.cursor/rules/showroom-standards/`:

=== ✅ Sequential Questioning
Claude asks ONE question at a time and waits for your answer. Won't ask all questions at once.

=== ✅ Token Management
Claude writes files directly (using Write tool) and shows only brief summaries. You won't see hundreds of lines of content in chat.

=== ✅ File Generation Order
For NEW labs: `index.adoc` → `01-overview.adoc` → `02-details.adoc` → `03-module-01-*.adoc`

=== ✅ File Naming
Consistent numbering: `index.adoc`, `01-overview.adoc`, `02-details.adoc`, `03-module-01-*.adoc`, `04-module-02-*.adoc`

=== ✅ External Links
All links open in new tab using `^` caret: `link:https://example.com[Text^]`

=== ✅ Dynamic Variables
Variables stay as placeholders: `{openshift_cluster_console_url}` (never replaced with actual values)

=== ✅ AgV Catalog Exact Copy
When using reference catalog, creates EXACT copy - only modifies UUID, name, slug, and showroom URL

== Example Usage

=== Creating Your First Lab Module

. Open this repository in Cursor
. Open Cursor chat (Cmd+L / Ctrl+L)
. Say: `create lab`
. Claude asks: "Are you creating a new lab or adding to an existing lab?"
. Answer: `new lab`
. Claude asks next question (one at a time)
. Continue answering questions
. Claude generates all files and shows summary

=== Adding a Module to Existing Lab

. In Cursor chat: `create lab`
. Answer: `existing lab`
. Provide path to previous module (or story recap)
. Answer questions sequentially
. Claude generates next module only

=== Creating a Demo

. In Cursor chat: `create demo`
. Answer questions about business scenario, audience, technology
. Claude generates Know/Show structured demo content

== Differences from Claude Code CLI

This Cursor setup provides the same workflow as Claude Code CLI skills, with these differences:

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Feature |Claude Code CLI |Cursor

|Skill invocation
|`/skills`, `create-lab`
|"create lab" in chat

|Skills menu
|✅ `/skills` command
|❌ Use specific commands

|Workflow
|Identical
|Identical

|File generation
|Identical
|Identical

|Quality checks
|Identical
|Identical
|===

*The workflow is the same* - just the invocation method differs.

== Troubleshooting

=== "Claude isn't following the skill"

*Solution*: Make sure you're saying one of the trigger commands:

* "create lab" (not just "create module")
* "create demo" (not just "demo")

Or be more explicit:
[source,text]
----
Read .claude/skills/create-lab/SKILL.md and follow ALL instructions
to create a workshop module. Ask questions one at a time.
----

=== "Getting too much output in chat"

*Reminder to Claude*:
[source,text]
----
Remember to use Write tool for files and show only brief summaries.
Follow token management rules from .cursor/rules/showroom-standards/.
----

=== "Questions asked all at once"

*Reminder to Claude*:
[source,text]
----
Remember to ask ONE question at a time and WAIT for my answer.
Follow sequential questioning rule from .cursor/rules/showroom-standards/.
----

=== "Variables replaced with actual values"

*Reminder to Claude*:
[source,text]
----
Keep all variables as {placeholders}. Do NOT replace with actual values.
Follow the dynamic variables rule from .cursor/rules/showroom-standards/.

. Update this README with skill documentation
. Test and commit

---

== Quick Reference Commands

Copy-paste these into Cursor chat:

[source,bash]
----
# Create new lab (generates index + overview + details + module-01)
create lab

# Add module to existing lab
create lab

# Create demo content
create demo

# Verify content quality
verify content

# Force skill to load (if auto-detection fails)
Read .claude/skills/create-lab/SKILL.md and follow all instructions
to create a workshop module. Ask questions one at a time.
