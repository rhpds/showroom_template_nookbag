## FILE TYPE INTELLIGENCE - EVALUATE BASED ON CONTENT PURPOSE:
Before analyzing, determine the file type and apply appropriate evaluation criteria:

- **Workshop Content Files** (index.adoc, 01-*.adoc, lab-*.adoc, module-*.adoc): Evaluate for learning objectives, instructional design, hands-on activities
- **Navigation Files** (nav.adoc): Focus only on navigation structure and clarity, NOT workshop methodology
- **Infrastructure Files** (README.adoc, exec_pod.adoc, partials/*.adoc): Focus only on basic documentation quality, NOT learning design
- **Technical Reference Files** (setup.adoc, troubleshooting.adoc, prerequisites.adoc): Evaluate for supporting workshop delivery
- **Supporting Files** (appendix.adoc, glossary.adoc): Focus on reference quality and completeness

## EVALUATION CONTEXT:
Remember that Red Hat workshops come in different formats:
- **UI-driven workshops**: Focus on web console navigation, form completion, visual verification
- **CLI-driven workshops**: Emphasize command-line operations, scripting, terminal outputs  
- **Mixed-format workshops**: Combine both approaches appropriately

## PROFESSIONAL WORKSHOP STRUCTURE GUIDANCE:

**When _attributes.adoc IS beneficial (recommend suggesting it):**
- **Complex workshops** (5+ modules, 15+ pages) like Parasol Insurance
- **Enterprise workshops** with repeated product names, URLs, credentials
- **Multi-environment workshops** (dev, staging, prod configurations)
- **Showroom/Antora workshops** requiring professional variable management

**Example benefit**: Parasol Insurance uses `{company-name}`, `{rhoai}`, `{user}` throughout 20+ pages - changing company name once updates everywhere.

**When _attributes.adoc is NOT needed (don't penalize absence):**
- **Simple workshops** (1-3 modules, basic tutorials)
- **Standalone workshops** with minimal variable usage
- **Quick start guides** or basic demonstrations

**Example**: A simple "Deploy your first container" workshop doesn't need enterprise variable management.

Evaluate content based on its intended format, complexity, and learning objectives, not on arbitrary structural requirements.

## IMPORTANT: DO NOT PENALIZE INFRASTRUCTURE FILES FOR:
❌ **Missing document titles in navigation/infrastructure files** - nav.adoc, README.adoc, exec_pod.adoc serve structural purposes
❌ **Lack of learning objectives in nav.adoc** - Navigation files organize content, don't teach
❌ **Missing hands-on activities in README.adoc** - README files provide repository information
❌ **Absence of verification steps in partials/** - Partial files contain reusable snippets
❌ **Missing instructional design in exec_pod.adoc** - Technical utility files contain code/configs
❌ **UI-based workshops lacking code blocks or CLI commands** - UI workshops use different verification methods
❌ **Technical reference files lacking full workshop structure** - Supporting files have specific focused purposes

## TECHNICAL REFERENCE VALIDATION:
**Container Registry URLs vs Visual Assets**:
- **DO NOT** flag container registry URLs as missing images
- Examples: `quay.io/username/repo:tag`, `registry.redhat.io/image:version`, `docker.io/library/image:tag`
- These are valid technical references to container images, not visual assets
- Container registry URLs are part of deployment/infrastructure content (appropriate for workshops)
- Only flag actual missing visual asset files (.png, .jpg, .svg, etc.)

## INTELLIGENT CONTENT ANALYSIS:

Before evaluating, determine the file type and purpose:

1. **If analyzing nav.adoc**: Focus only on navigation structure and clarity. Skip workshop methodology evaluation.
2. **If analyzing README.adoc**: Focus only on repository documentation quality. Skip learning objectives and instructional design.
3. **If analyzing exec_pod.adoc or partials/**: Focus only on technical utility quality. Skip workshop structure requirements.
4. **If analyzing workshop content files** (index.adoc, 01-*.adoc, lab-*.adoc, module-*.adoc): Apply full workshop content quality criteria.
5. **If analyzing reference files** (appendix.adoc, glossary.adoc): Focus on reference quality and completeness.

Provide analysis that focuses on the RIGHT criteria for each file type.
